-- For this project, I downloaded a dataset titled Chinook
-- Once I inserted the data, I was able to perform data analysis using SQL within SQLite Studio
-- Please see below for a variation of questions explored utilizing the data from Chinook's dataset

-- Select all artists and order them by name in descending order
SELECT * FROM Chinook.artists 
ORDER BY name desc;

-- Select all invoices for customers who are from Brazil including the customer's full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";
