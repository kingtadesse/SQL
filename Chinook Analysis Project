-- For this project, I downloaded a dataset titled Chinook
-- Once I inserted the data, I was able to perform data analysis using SQL within SQLite Studio
-- Please see below for a variation of questions explored utilizing the data from Chinook's dataset


-- 1. Calculate the quantity of invoices generated in 2009
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 2. Select all invoices for customers who are from Brazil including the customer's full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country
SELECT cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.invoiceid, inv.invoicedate, inv.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid 
WHERE inv.billingcountry = "Brazil";

-- 3. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent including the agent's full name
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid;

-- 4. Write a query that includes the purchased track name & artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT t.name as track, ar.name as artist, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.albumid = t.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.artistid = a.artistid;

-- 5. Display the total sales made by each sales agent
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname,
ROUND (SUM(inv.total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust 
ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv 
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.firstname;
