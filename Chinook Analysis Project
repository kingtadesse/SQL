-- For this project, I downloaded a dataset titled Chinook
-- Once I inserted the data, I was able to perform data analysis using SQL within SQLite Studio
-- Please see below for a variation of questions explored utilizing the data from Chinook's dataset

-- Select all artists and order them by name in descending order
SELECT * FROM chinook.artists 
ORDER BY name desc;

-- Select all invoices for customers who are from Brazil including the customer's full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country
SELECT cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.invoiceid, inv.invoicedate, inv.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid 
WHERE inv.billingcountry = "Brazil";

-- Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent including the agent's full name
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid;

-- Write a query that includes the purchased track name & artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT ar.name as artist, t.name as track, i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.albumid = t.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.artistid = a.artistid;
